encore-cmd is meant to explore a script-based configuration management tool using a cmdfile that resembles the syntax of Dockerfile. Though you can do the same with just plain shell script, encore-cmd incorporates Anko script engine so you can do scripting with commands from Go language minus the data types.


Installation
------------

You must have Go installed.

go get github.com/ibmendoza/encore-cmd

To run, type encore-cmd /path/of/cmdfile
